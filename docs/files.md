# Files and editor

The Files pane is a lazy workspace explorer beside Monaco editor tabs. Gitignore
and hidden-file filters, git status dots and filesystem watching are always on.
A 250 ms debounced watcher patches changed directory listings; agent tool results
refresh every loaded listing immediately, and a two-second directory-mtime poll
covers unavailable or missed watcher events. Reopening the pane re-reads its root,
and the toolbar refresh button re-reads the visible lazy tree on demand.
It exists so you can read and fix the thing the agent just touched without
leaving the conversation.

Opening a file or switching editor tabs expands its ancestor folders, highlights
its row and scrolls it into view without taking keyboard focus. Only that path
is loaded, and hidden/gitignore filters still apply. Cmd/Ctrl+P opens the Files
pane on the explorer tree, replacing the content-search panel if it was open.
Content search keeps its results visible while stepping through matches; returning
to the explorer reveals the active file.

## File management

- **Create:** toolbar buttons create inside the selected folder (or beside a
  selected file), or at the workspace root with nothing selected. Empty-space
  right-click targets the root; row menus target that row's folder.
- **Rename / Delete:** row menu, F2, Delete (Cmd+Backspace also works). Delete
  moves to Trash after confirmation and warns about unsaved edits. Rename keeps
  descendant editor buffers; a successful delete closes their tabs.
- **Copy / Cut / Paste:** context menu or Cmd/Ctrl+C, X, V while the explorer
  has focus. Copying beside the original makes a numbered "copy". Cut moves
  within the active workspace and clears only the entries that actually moved.
- **Multiple entries:** Cmd/Ctrl-click toggles, Shift-click selects a visible
  range, Cmd/Ctrl+A selects visible rows. Copy, cut and drag act on the
  selection. Rename and Delete want exactly one entry.
- **Drop:** drag files or folders from the OS into the tree to copy them in. A
  folder row targets that folder, a file row its parent, empty space the root.
  Internal drags move; Option/Ctrl-drag copies. The destination highlights.
- **Import:** right-click → Import files / Import folders opens a native
  picker.
- **Navigate:** Up/Down and Home/End move focus, Left/Right collapse and
  expand, Enter opens. Reveal and copy-path stay in the menu. Refresh preserves
  a selected entry that still exists and clears the selection when it was removed.

Existing destinations are refused, never merged or replaced. Transfers report
partial failures, and a completed move retargets its open editors at once.
Copying a folder preserves symlinks without following them. Destinations
outside the workspace (symlink escapes included) and self-nesting are refused.
A failed copy can leave a partial destination; the source is never touched.

The system clipboard accepts incoming Finder/Explorer/Linux file lists;
ordinary copied text is never read as a file. Outbound file paste into OS file
managers is not implemented (Phosphor-to-Phosphor copy/cut works). Cross-device
moves fail safely: copy, then delete.

## Search in files

Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+F, or the magnifier in the explorer toolbar, swaps the explorer
for a search panel (`features/files/WorkspaceSearch.tsx`). A one-line
selection, on the page or in the editor, seeds the query, escaped when Regex is
on. Results arrive as you type, 250 ms after the last
key, grouped by file. Each line keeps its match in view however narrow the
pane: the text after the match gives way first, then the text before it. The
Match case / Whole word / Regex toggles and their ⌥C, ⌥W, ⌥R keys are the same
ones find uses. The ⋯ header toggle shows **Files to include** and **Files to
exclude**: comma-separated globs (`shared/glob.ts`). `*.ts` matches at any
depth, a folder name covers everything under it, and a leading `/` anchors a
pattern at the workspace root. Matching ignores case.

- **Open a match:** a click opens the file with the match selected and leaves
  focus in the list, so you can keep stepping. Double-click or Enter moves
  focus into the editor, and Space opens without moving focus. HTML and SVG
  open on their Source view, where the match is.
- **Navigate:** Down from the field enters the list. Up/Down and Home/End move,
  and Left/Right fold a file or move between it and its matches. Esc in the
  list, or Up from its first row, returns to the field; Esc in the field
  returns to the explorer, which takes focus.
- **State:** the query, options, globs and results are per workspace. They
  survive closing the panel or the pane, and the header's refresh re-runs the
  search.

The search runs in main, in a worker thread
(`electron/fs/workspace-search-service.ts`). Each keystroke's search replaces
the window's last one, and a regex that backtracks without end is terminated
with its worker instead of freezing the app. The query and globs are compiled
once, by the same code in the panel and in main (`shared/workspace-search.ts`),
so a bad regex or glob says so as you type. It reads the files the fuzzy finder
lists: git's tracked and untracked files without the ignored ones, or a bounded
walk outside a repository. It never follows a symlink, to a file or through a
folder out of the workspace. Binary files (a NUL in the first 8 KB), images,
video, audio, PDFs and files over 4 MB are skipped and counted. Lines end where
the editor ends them, at LF, CRLF or a lone CR, so a result's line and column
land on the match. A search stops at 2,000 results, after 20 seconds (the
listing included), or at the 20,000th listed file, and the panel says which
limit it hit and keeps what it found.

## Editor

Monaco gives you syntax highlighting, its bundled basic language services,
open-file tabs, dirty indicators and Cmd/Ctrl+S. Saves to the same path are
serialized and mark only the written revision clean; edits made during a save
remain dirty. Closing a dirty tab asks Save / Don’t Save / Cancel. Save failures
or newer edits keep the tab open; Escape cancels. Failed saves retain the buffer and show an error. A reload that
finishes after typing preserves the newer buffer and reports a conflict.
Clean buffers reload on external change; dirty ones show a conflict bar so an outside edit never
silently eats your work. Clicking a file leaves keyboard focus in the explorer
for file shortcuts; click the editor to type. Open-at-line navigation focuses
the editor; a single click on a search result is the exception. Asking again
for a line already open reveals it again, and switching back to a tab never
jumps it to an old target.

Binary files and files over 4 MB can be managed but not edited as text. Not
included: a debugger, external language servers, split editors, bulk delete,
transfer undo, previews of Office documents or archives (use Open in default
app or Quick Look).

## Reverting session changes

Revert restores only the working copy, leaving staged Git content untouched.
An unavailable baseline or a read error refuses the operation; only confirmed
absence from a valid baseline permits moving a newly created file to Trash.
Unsaved editor buffers must be saved or discarded first. Writes without a Git
baseline cannot be safely reverted automatically, so that action is disabled.
Revert failures are shown as errors rather than disappearing silently.

## Previews

Images, video, audio, PDFs, HTML and markdown open in a viewer instead of
Monaco. The extension decides (`shared/file-kinds.ts`); the size cap does not
apply to media, so a multi-gigabyte video opens and seeks. HTML, SVG and
markdown keep a Preview/Source toggle; the HTML/SVG preview shows the saved
file, and says so while the buffer has unsaved edits. Every other file that
cannot be edited as text gets a card with **Open in default app**, **Quick
Look** (macOS) and **Reveal**.

Markdown renders in-app with the same renderer as chat — GFM tables, Mermaid
diagrams, KaTeX — from the live buffer, so the preview follows unsaved edits.
Relative images resolve over the workspace's `phosphor-file://` document
grant; relative links open in the Files pane like any path link in chat. A
newly created file opens straight in the editor, not as a blank preview.

The viewers load from `phosphor-file://`, which serves only what main granted
by an unguessable token (`electron/fs/file-protocol.ts`): one file for media
and PDFs, or the workspace for an HTML page or a markdown file, so relative
CSS, images and scripts resolve. Paths are realpath'd and must stay under the grant; `..` and
symlinks out of it get 404. Video streams with Range requests.

A previewed HTML page runs its scripts in `sandbox="allow-scripts"` under a
policy with no network: it can show sibling files but not `fetch` them, and a
page that loads a library from a CDN renders without it — open it externally
for that. Any frame navigating to http(s) or `file:` is cancelled. PDFs use
Chromium's built-in viewer; links in a PDF open in your browser.

**Open in default app** refuses anything the OS would run rather than open —
apps, installers, scripts, shortcuts, and on macOS/Linux any file with an
execute bit — and does not follow symlinks. Reveal it and decide yourself.
