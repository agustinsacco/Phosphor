## Locked technical decisions

| Area                 | Decision                                                                                            |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Shell                | Electron (current stable), TypeScript everywhere, strict mode                                       |
| Renderer             | React 19, Vite (electron-vite), Tailwind CSS 4                                                      |
| State                | Zustand (per-domain stores); no Redux                                                               |
| Code viewing/editing | Monaco Editor (also provides the diff editor)                                                       |
| Terminal             | xterm.js + node-pty (real PTY, user shell, full interactivity)                                      |
| Markdown             | Streaming-tolerant react-markdown pipeline (remark-gfm, remark-math, rehype-katex); Shiki           |
| Diagrams             | Mermaid, client-side                                                                                |
| Math                 | KaTeX (via remark-math + rehype-katex)                                                              |
| Charts               | Two fences: `chart` JSON → Chart.js, `vega-lite` JSON → vega-embed                                  |
| HTML preview         | `<iframe sandbox="allow-scripts">` over `phosphor-artifact://`, never `srcDoc`; Code/Preview toggle |
| File watching        | chokidar (main process)                                                                             |
| Packaging            | electron-builder → macOS (dmg+zip, arm64+x64), Linux (AppImage+deb), Windows (nsis)                 |
| Install              | GitHub Releases + `curl … install.sh \| sh` (`tools/scripts/install.sh`)                            |
| IPC                  | Typed contextBridge preload; renderer never touches Node APIs                                       |
| pi integration       | RPC subprocess, one `pi --mode rpc` per live session ([pi-integration.md](pi-integration.md))       |

```

The main-side names are literal: `SessionRegistry` (`apps/desktop/electron/pi/session-registry.ts`,
single instance exported as `registry` from `apps/desktop/electron/registry.ts`) holds every
live session ↔ `PiRpcClient` (`libs/session-runtime/src/pi/rpc-client.ts`) pair; `ptyManager`
(`apps/desktop/electron/pty/pty-manager.ts`) owns the PTYs. There is no WorkspaceManager and
no SessionManager class — filesystem and git are plain function modules
(`apps/desktop/electron/fs/fs-service.ts`, `git-service.ts`), and watching is two chokidar
users, `apps/desktop/electron/fs/workspace-watcher.ts` for the file tree and
`apps/desktop/electron/pi/session-watcher.ts` for the sessions dir.

The RPC transport, strict JSONL decoder and activity tracker live in `libs/session-runtime/src/pi/`.
The transport accepts explicit logging and shutdown ports and does not import
Electron. Desktop callers use `apps/desktop/electron/pi/desktop-rpc-client.ts` to bind those
ports to the existing app logger and shutdown approval. Session ownership lives
in `libs/session-runtime/src/pi/session-registry.ts`, which receives a client factory and an
admission check. `apps/desktop/electron/pi/session-registry.ts` binds both to the same desktop
client and shutdown approval as before; `apps/desktop/electron/registry.ts` still creates the
only live desktop registry. Creation/disposal events, crash retention and
ownership until process exit are unchanged.

Launch preparation lives in `libs/session-runtime/src/pi/session-launch.ts`, with explicit
executable, environment and resource-root dependencies. The desktop adapter
in `apps/desktop/electron/pi/session-launch.ts` keeps existing pi discovery and caching, shell
PATH, provider environment and packaged-resource selection. The test stub still
uses the single unpackaged-only gate in `stub.ts`. `libs/session-runtime/src/pi/session-policy.ts`
selects project directives, validates the predicted provider and prepares account
and compression overlays before compaction repair. Its Desktop adapter supplies
machine-local preferences, Git, packages, accounts and Headroom state.
`libs/session-runtime/src/pi/session-startup.ts` owns cwd normalization/repair, preparation,
allocation, event binding, readiness, cancellation and failure disposal. Desktop
supplies live budget/routine callbacks, account bookkeeping, recents and a sink.
Failure while binding the sink or recording startup metadata also stops the
child. `libs/session-runtime/src/pi/session-service.ts` owns create/resume admission, command
preflight, extension responses and disposal. Both Desktop IPC and routine startup
use this service. Resumes reuse live writers, retire crashed handles and reject
missing files; routine ownership is checked again after a queued command waits.
`createSessionPathRuntime()` gives each owner an independent lock domain, shared
with its deletion path. Desktop binds one instance in `session-path-lock.ts`.
`libs/session-runtime/src/pi/session-deletion.ts` cancels active/queued resumes, stops every writer
and handles identities learned during shutdown before invoking storage hooks.
An owner can refuse inside the lock, before anything stops (`assertDeletable`):
the Host refuses a running session, and Desktop sets no hook.
Desktop keeps its existing Trash, legacy-ledger and draft cleanup adapters.
These are in-process locks, not cross-process Host ownership or network authority.

Directive composition, provider detection, pi path rules and safe session-header
repair also live in `libs/session-runtime/src/pi/`. The same-named Desktop modules re-export them
for existing callers. `boundary.test.ts` bundles every runtime entry for Node
and rejects Electron or `apps/desktop/electron/` dependencies.

Context-budget enforcement and command serialization live in
`libs/session-runtime/src/pi/context-budget.ts`. Each runtime instance owns its gates and receives
a logger; budget and routine-pause callbacks are still read live. The existing
`apps/desktop/electron/pi/context-budget.ts` exports bind one instance for all Desktop callers.
The compaction policy, cancellation behavior and RPC messages are unchanged.

`libs/session-runtime/src/pi/session-events.ts` binds whole session events to an injected sink,
logger, budget observer and extension-UI policy. Listener order is preserved.
`apps/desktop/electron/pi/session-events.ts` owns Desktop delivery: renderer-only trimming,
unattended dialog suppression, target-window delivery and broadcast fallback.
This is an in-process boundary, not a network subscription or replay service.

`libs/session-runtime/src/` is shared source code, not an extra running service. Phosphor Desktop
still starts one pi subprocess per live local session. Moving these modules does
not install Phosphor Host on the local machine, enable a listener, require login,
or change session ownership, pi arguments or on-disk formats.

- **Main process owns all side effects**: pi subprocesses, PTYs, filesystem, git, watchers, dialogs, app prefs.
- **Renderer is pure UI** over typed IPC. `contextIsolation: true`, `nodeIntegration: false`, `sandbox: true` (`apps/desktop/electron/main.ts`), strict CSP in `apps/desktop/src/index.html`. Model-authored HTML renders only in the sandboxed iframe — and only via a `phosphor-artifact://` URL, because a `srcdoc` document inherits the embedder's policy container and the app's own `script-src 'self'` would silently refuse every inline script (`apps/desktop/src/components/SandboxedHtml.tsx`). Workspace files reach the Files pane's viewers over a second scheme, `phosphor-file://`, which serves only token-granted files and gives HTML the same sandbox and no-network policy (`apps/desktop/electron/fs/file-protocol.ts`, [files.md](files.md#previews)). Both schemes are registered in one `registerSchemesAsPrivileged` call — Electron honours only one. A frame navigating itself to http(s) or `file:` is refused twice: by the app's `frame-src`, and by a `will-frame-navigate` guard that does not depend on that policy.
- **IPC design**: request/response methods (`invoke`) for commands, push channels (`send`) for streams. Namespace per domain, **18 prefixes today**: `pi:*` (session lifecycle, RPC passthrough, agent settings, provider login), `app:*` (prefs, dialogs, theme, drafts, sandboxes), `git:*` (including worktrees — there is no `worktrees:*`), `claude:*` (pi-claude-cli accounts, login, usage), `sessions:*` (on-disk scan, tree, fork/jump, delete), `mcp:*`, `fs:*`, `skills:*`, `packages:*`, `pty:*`, `headroom:*`, `updates:*`, `maintenance:*`, `gh:*`, `clipboard:*`, `optimization:*` (`optimization:stats`, one channel), `artifacts:*`, and `routines:*` (local schedules, history, and execution controls). Every message type is declared in [`libs/shared/src/ipc.ts`](../libs/shared/src/ipc.ts) — count prefixes there, not here, if the two ever disagree.
- **Data flow for one streamed prompt**: renderer `pi:command` with `{type:"prompt"}` → main writes one JSONL line to child stdin → child stdout events parsed by `PiRpcClient` → forwarded on `pi:event:<sessionId>` (`sessionEventChannel()` in `libs/shared/src/ipc.ts`) → `reduceChatEvent` (`apps/desktop/src/features/chat/reducer.ts`) folds events into message view-models → virtualized list renders deltas.

## Repo layout

**See the tree in [the README](../README.md#repo-layout).** It used to be
duplicated here; the copy drifted (it named a `types/ipc.ts` that never existed,
listed 6 of the feature folders, and 2 pi extensions), so this section is a
pointer now. As of today `apps/desktop/src/features/` has **15** folders (artifacts, chat,
connectors, extension-ui, files, home, palette, sessions, settings, skills,
terminal, updates, workspaces, worktrees, routines) and `libs/pi-extensions/pi-ext/` has **6** modules —
`artifacts`, `context-breakdown`, `worktree-paths`, `tool-name-guard`,
`mcp-status`, `headroom` — **all six** loaded into every session by
`bundledExtensions()` in `libs/session-runtime/src/bundled-extensions.ts`, called by
`libs/session-runtime/src/pi/session-launch.ts`. Those two
numbers move; the tree in the README is the thing to re-read, not this
paragraph.

Local [routines](routines.md) reuse the window-independent session runtime and
registry. A transactional SQLite ledger owns scheduled occurrences, not live
processes. Its bounded scheduler manages only explicit routine executions;
interactive sessions remain independent and are not reclaimed by it.

## Cross-cutting requirements

- Single source of truth for session state lives in main (`SessionRegistry`: live sessions ↔ pi children); renderer stores are projections.
- All long/streaming output is incrementally reduced — never rebuild whole message arrays per delta.
- Work whose cost the user's input decides runs off main's thread. The workspace search runs each query in its own worker thread (`apps/desktop/electron/fs/workspace-search-service.ts`): a regex can backtrack for minutes on one line, and a worker can be terminated mid-match where main's thread would freeze every window.
- Every feature works on macOS, Linux, Windows (path handling via `node:path`, PTY shells per-OS: `$SHELL` / PowerShell).
- App prefs in electron-store — `AppPrefs` in [`libs/shared/src/models.ts`](../libs/shared/src/models.ts): theme, recent/last workspace, last + pinned sessions, model picks, lane markers and `lanes`, `fonts` (UI scale and the three font sizes), agent directives (global and per-project), worktrees, maintenance, headroom. **Pane layout is not among them**: it is per-session and lives in `localStorage` under `phosphor-pane-layout` (`apps/desktop/src/stores/layout.ts`), because it is view state that should not survive a prefs migration or cost an IPC round-trip per drag.
- Prefs are never written into pi's config files. pi config editing is explicit and user-initiated ([settings.md](settings.md)).
