/**
 * Which session files a rewind replaced, and what replaced them.
 *
 * pi never edits a session file in place: its `fork` command copies the
 * branch into a new `TIMESTAMP_UUID.jsonl` and moves the running session onto
 * it, leaving the old file on disk. After a rewind that read as the chat
 * having duplicated itself, two rows with one title, and a user who reopened
 * the old one ran a second agent in the same worktree.
 *
 * The files alone cannot tell a rewind from a deliberate fork or clone (they
 * have the same shape, which is why the content-based guess of #153 was
 * removed in #331). So the decision is made by the ACTION: `rewindToEntry`
 * records `old → new` here, and nothing else does. Rewinds from before the
 * record existed stay visible on purpose.
 *
 * Keyed by FILE NAME, never by path. Renaming a workspace folder moves its
 * whole transcript directory, and a path-keyed record stopped matching (the
 * five identical rows of #267). The name is a timestamp plus a UUID, unique on
 * its own.
